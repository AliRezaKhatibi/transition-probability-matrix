Obtaining the transition probability matrix of a Markov chain
In mathematics, a random matrix (also called a probability matrix, transition matrix, substitution matrix, or Markov matrix) is a matrix used to describe the transitions of a Markov chain. Each row of this matrix is ​​a non-negative real number that represents the probability.
In this project, an arbitrary graph has been created, which is displayed in the code p_k_1_train.ipynb, and its transfer probability matrix has been calculated and exponentiated, and finally, the stable probability matrix has been obtained.
